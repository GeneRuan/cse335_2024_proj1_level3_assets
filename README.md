# cse335_2024_proj1_level3_assets
Assets for level 3 of project 1 for a CSE335 class at MSU.

For level 3, it is based on having a semi-original song instead of a placeholder, with 
higher quality being more qualified for ten points of extra credit.

As such, as I have tasked myself to making the third level, there is a theme to it.

Our game mechanic is the Danger Note, a game asset that acts as a note. 
This is meant to stand out, and punish players for hitting them.

The asset, song, and sound effect are based on Deltarune, a RPG that plays with the typical tropes of RPGs.

The asset is the Pipis, the weird projectile summoned by "EV3RY  BUDDY  'S FAVORITE [[Number 1 Rated Salesman1997]]"
Spamton G. Spamton. Its use as an oddball fits well as the note you don't want to hit.

The song is from Seek's Cool Deltarune Mod, being "Chips Ahoyeth". This is based on a battle in the game 
between Rouxls Kaard (Rules Card), and the heroes Ralsei and Kris. None of their voices are being used in the song.

The sound effect for hitting the Danger Note is "snd_hurt1_bc", the sound effect for being hit in battle in Deltarune.
This is a pretty good indicator of failing to avoid the note, and fits with the consequence of hitting the Pipis in the game.

I do not own Deltarune, nor am I the original author of Seek's Cool Deltarune Mod.
Deltarune made by Toby Fox, Temmie Chang, and 8-4 Ltd. 
Seek's Cool Deltarune Mod by Seek's Animation and Stuff, or @Seeks_stuff on YouTube.
